The module itself is in the module/ directory.  To build and insert the
module into your kernel:
    cd module
    make
    insmod asus_eee.ko

Usage:  once the module has been inserted, several files will appear in the
/proc/eee directory:

    pll - Reading this file will dump the current configuration data from
          the PLL chip.
    fsb - Reading this file will return the current FSB and voltage settings,
          while writing to this file will change the FSB and voltage.  The
          format of this file is three integers:
            <PLL N multiplier>  <PLL M divisor>  <CPU voltage>
          CPU voltage is 0 for "low" and 1 for "high".
    fan_rpm - The current speed of the fan in revolutions per minute.
    fan_speed - The current speed (0-100%) the fan is set to.
    fan_manual - When 0, the embedded controller turns the fan on and off
                 according to the CPU temperature.  When 1, writing to
                 fan_speed will change the speed of the fan;  the embedded
                 controller makes no changes on its own.
    temperature - The temperature of the CPU (in degrees C).

Note that when the fan is in manual mode, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESTROY YOUR CPU!
It appears that the embedded controller will happily allow the temperature to
reach 90C (the CRITICAL temperature of the CPU), at which point a thermal
shutdown will be initiated.  This will turn the fan to 100%, throttle the CPU,
and probably even shutdown the machine.  Your CPU may or may not survive this
treatment...
