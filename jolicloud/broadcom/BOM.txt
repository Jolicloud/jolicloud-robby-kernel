The broadcom directory has been modified to contain a patches subdirectory.
Those will get applied at buildtime.

As the ^M problem seems to be gone now and the newer series use an unpacked
base I converted Hardy to do the same. So the tarballs are now. The binary
blob will get linked based on $(ARCH).

In order to get Broadcom updates to work well I had to repackage the
original tarball from the website such that all of the Makefile's and *.[ch] files
were stripped of their '^M' trailing characters. Can you say Windoze? I also
inserted a directory into which the tarball unpacks, e.g., hybrid-portsrc-x86-32_5_10_27_11.
